**Project Website Requirements**

To ensure the best experience while using our project website, please follow these requirements:

1. Screen Resolution and Browser Zoom Level:
   - For the best layout and user experience, it's recommended to use a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.
   - Set your browser zoom level to 80% for optimal display.
   - Ensure that your browser window is in full-screen mode for the best view. 

3. Data Location:
   - The final data used in our project is located in the "src/All data in one" directory.
   - In this directory, you will find two main data files: "Q.csv" and "data.json".
   - We used "Q.csv" and "data.json" because the format of the data had to be modified several time to make our visualizations work correctly.

4. External Libraries:
   - We discovered in the end that it's possible that our website uses external libraries or resources that are not included locally in the project files.
   - The libary should be the slider's and the Sankey diagram.
   - We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We didn't mange to find a solution.

Thank you for using our project website. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to contact us.
