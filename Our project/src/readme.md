* Is there a discernible relationship between the upward trend in life expectancy at birth and the concurrent decline in fertility rates across countries from 1960 to 2016?
    * Life expectancy and fertility rate.
* Are there countries where the fertility rate has consistently exceeded the replacement rate throughout this timeframe?
    * Fertility rate and **replacement rate (derived attribute)**
* What are the demographic implications of countries with declining fertility rates, particularly in terms of population aging?
    * Fertility rate and life expectancy
* Can you predict future population growth and life expectancy trends based on historical data and apply them to current and future policy planning?
    * Life expectancy, **population growth (derived attribute)**, policy planning from countries
* How do fertility rates and life expectancy trends differ between developed and developing countries?
    * Fertility rate, life expectancy and **developped countries (search for data)**
* Can you detect any significant anomalies or outliers in the dataset that require further investigation, such as countries with exceptionally high or low fertility rates or life expectancies?
    * All good

# replacement rate:
Replacement Rate = Total Fertility Rate (TFR) / Net Reproduction Rate (NRR)
* TFR is the average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime, given the current age-specific birth rates. To calculate TFR, you sum up the age-specific fertility rates for all age groups of women of childbearing age. The formula for TFR is: 
TFR = Σ(Births in Each Age Group) / Total Number of Women in Each Age Group

* NRR is a measure of how many daughters a woman can expect to have who will survive to reproductive age and have daughters of their own. To calculate NRR, you consider the age-specific fertility rates and the age-specific survival rates. The formula for NRR is: 
NRR = Σ(Survival Rate x Age-Specific Fertility Rate) / Total Number of Women in Each Age Group

# population growth:
* Population Growth Rate = (Birth Rate - Death Rate) + Net Migration Rate
Calculate the average annual birth rate (B) over the time period. You can do this by taking the difference in the total number of births over the period and dividing it by the number of years in that period:
Average Annual Birth Rate (B) = (Total Births in the Period) / (Number of Years)

* Calculate the average annual death rate (D) over the time period. You can estimate the death rate from life expectancy by assuming that a higher life expectancy corresponds to a lower death rate. For example, if the life expectancy in a certain year is 75 years, you can assume a death rate of 1/75 per year:
Average Annual Death Rate (D) = 1 / (Life Expectancy)

* Determine the net migration rate (N). This is the difference between the number of people moving into the country (immigration) and the number of people leaving the country (emigration) over the time period. You'll need separate data for immigration and emigration.
